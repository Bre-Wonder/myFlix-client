# myFlix Client React App

## Project Description
  The myFlix-client React application allows users to find a list of movies from a database. A user can both update user information and find lists and details about movies in the database. The user information can also be updated to change four fields: username, email, password, and birtdate. Each user has a unique token that allows the user to be recognized and their account set up uniquely. A user can select movies from the homepage to add to their favorite movies list in their profile view. myFlix-Client is set up as a Single Page Application with routing elements to all the user different viewpoints.
